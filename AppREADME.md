[Maintain Final Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12ynBXO15Q3RfUzasR_p7aV2fR8OneNsCB126_qBlVIQ/edit?usp=sharing) 

Maintain is a MERN Stack web application designed to help domestic violence victims maintain their quality of life. Features include secure web journals that allow users to document daily life and resources for help, assistance, and nearby places (lawyers, police stations, hospitals). 

## Instructions
Users can sign up for a Maintain account using Auth0, either with an email and password or a preexisting Google account. Once signed in they can document daily life within their own secure web journal. 

In addition, users can locate and get directions to near by lawyers, police stations, and hospitals.

Finally, on the "Learn More" tab, users can view a curated list of resources about domestic violence and abuse in order to understand their current situtation and make a plan to maintain their quality of life.
